# Forecast-of-Flood-Level
The projection of the extent of inundation corresponding to flood level forecasts in a river
# Project Overview
The projection of the extent of inundation corresponding to flood level forecasts in a river involves using hydrodynamic and flood inundation models to translate predicted river water levels into spatial maps showing flooded areas. These projections provide detailed information on how far and deep floodwaters may spread across floodplains and nearby regions. Typically, such projects integrate forecast data from river gauges, advanced 2D or machine learning-based models, digital elevation data, and meteorological inputs to produce timely inundation maps at high resolution. The resulting forecasts often include flood alerts categorized by depth and help authorities and communities prepare emergency responses by visualizing areas at risk of inundation up to village or infrastructure levels for a 1–2 day advance period. This integrated approach enhances flood risk management by providing actionable, location-specific flood extent information based on river stage forecasts.
# Objectives
The project aims to provide accurate flood extent forecasts by mapping inundation areas based on river flood level predictions. It supports timely early warnings for disaster preparedness and risk mitigation. This helps authorities and communities to plan and respond effectively to flood events.
